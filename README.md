# Cori - The Chatbot

Cori is aimed to be a universally accessible chatbot that serves as a one-stop-shop for all the basic information on Coronavirus. This would help save precious lives by increasing accessibility to information, reducing panic and misinformation and optimizing available medical resources. Ultimately, the goal is to relieve strain off the medical authorities by automating menial tasks to a chatbot.

We believe Cori can help save precious lives by:
- Improving accessibility to basic information regarding coronavirus
- Relieve strain off from labs and medical authorities by helping people understand that not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. A lot of people panic and get tested despite not having little or not symptoms. Through a series of questions, Cori will help you understand whether you need to be tested or not?
- Helping combat the spread of fake news and bad medical advice through our verification cell
- Helping disseminate the best precautionary measures and medical advice to the masses, collected from authorities like CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) WHO (World Health Organization)
- Maintaining an index of local resources such as “where to get tested?” or a helpline etc. to direct you to as needed
